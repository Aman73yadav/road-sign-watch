website link: https://road-sign-watch.vercel.app/

I tried to find the **GitHub repository and the README.md** for the project you linked: **[https://road-sign-watch.vercel.app/](https://road-sign-watch.vercel.app/)** — but **I couldn’t locate a corresponding GitHub repo** just from the public web search results or by guessing names like *road-sign-watch* or *traffic-sign-recognition*.

Here’s what I attempted and what I found:

### 🔎 What Was Checked

* I looked for *road-sign-watch* on GitHub and searched by the app name — but there were **no direct matches or accessible repositories** returned.
  (Attempting to open `github.com/search?q=road-sign-watch` triggered an error so direct browsing wasn’t possible.) 

* The deployed Vercel URL loads a “Traffic Sign Recognition” web page, but the underlying code link (repository) isn’t exposed publicly on the site itself. ([road-sign-watch.vercel.app][1])

* I also searched for keywords like *traffic sign recognition GitHub*, *road sign watch github* and variants — and found **other unrelated open-source projects** such as traffic sign recognition demos using YOLO or CNN models — but **none tied directly to your Vercel app**. ([GitHub][2])

### 🧠 What This Means

The deployed app likely:

1. **Is from a private GitHub repository** that hasn’t been made public yet
   → So GitHub search doesn’t return anything.

2. **Has not linked the repository in the app UI or meta information**
   → There’s no visible “View source on GitHub” button or link.

### 🙋 What You Can Do

To generate a README.md file for the project, you need one of these:

✅ A link to the actual **GitHub repository** (if public or you have access)
👉 For example: `https://github.com/username/road-sign-watch`

or

📌 Some code files from the project (so I can infer structure and write a README)

### 📌 If You Have the Code

Paste the repository link or some core files (`package.json`, `next.config.js`, frontend and backend code).
I can **generate a complete README.md** for you based on the code.

### 📌 If You Want a Template README

Here’s a generic **README template** you can adapt for a typical Traffic Sign Recognition web app:

````markdown
# Road Sign Watch

A **real-time traffic sign recognition web app** deployed on Vercel.  
This project identifies traffic sign types from camera input or image upload — helping with road safety and analysis.

## 📸 Features

- 📍 Detects and classifies road signs in images/video
- 🚀 Built with modern frontend stack (React/Next.js)
- ⚡ Fast inference via client-side or API calls
- 🧠 Uses pre-trained ML model (TensorFlow.js / PyTorch backend)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python API (if any)  
- **Machine Learning:** Traffic sign detection model (YOLO / CNN)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## 🧠 Installation

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-sign-watch
   cd road-sign-watch
````

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run dev server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Upload an image or enable camera
2. App detects road signs
3. Shows bounding boxes and labels
